üìù **Abstract Excerpt:**
We describe our submission for the NLI4CT 2024 shared task on robust Natural Language Inference over clinical trial reports. Our system is an ensemble of nine diverse models aggregated via majority voting. Ranging from a straightforward Convolutional Neural Network to few-shot-prompted language models, our approach exhibits a wide spectrum of strategies. Surprisingly, some individual ensemble members outperform the final model in both accuracy and robustness.

### Lispy - A Lisp dialect

Lispy is a functional programming language with an interpreted nature and a homoiconic design, drawing inspiration from the Lisp programming language developed in 1958. The interpreter is written in C, utilizing the MPC library for parsing operations. Lispy serves as an Interactive Prompt, enabling users to evaluate expressions in real-time or to evaluate external files written in the Lispy language.
