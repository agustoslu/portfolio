üìù **Abstract:**
This project explores methods to enhance sign language translation of German sign language, specifically focusing on disambiguation of homonyms. Sign language is ambiguous and understudied which is the basis for our experiments. We approach the improvement by training transformer-based models on various bodypart representations to shift the focus on said bodypart. To determine the impact of, e.g., the hand or mouth representations, we experiment with different combinations. The results show that focusing on the mouth increases the performance in small dataset settings while shifting the focus on the hands retrieves better results in larger dataset settings. Our results contribute to better accessibility for non-hearing persons by improving the systems powering digital assistants, enabling a more accurate interaction. The code for this project can be found on [GitHub.](https://github.com/OvrK12/slt)

üìù **Abstract:**
In this paper, we describe our submission for the NLI4CT 2024 shared task on robust Natural Language Inference over clinical trial reports. Our system is an ensemble of nine diverse models which we aggregate via majority voting. The models use a large spectrum of different approaches ranging from a straightforward Convolutional Neural Network over fine-tuned Large Language Models to few-shot-prompted language models using chain-of-thought reasoning.Surprisingly, we find that some individual ensemble members are not only more accurate than the final ensemble model but also more robust.

### Lispy - A Lisp dialect

Lispy is a functional programming language with an interpreted nature and a homoiconic design, drawing inspiration from the Lisp programming language developed in 1958. The interpreter is written in C, utilizing the MPC library for parsing operations. Lispy serves as an Interactive Prompt, enabling users to evaluate expressions in real-time or to evaluate external files written in the Lispy language.
